# Clustering a Dataset with OpenRefine
Hello there,  
This is Sabbir Ahmed Sibli, currently studying MSc. in Computer Science, BRAC University.  
This Presentation has been submitted as partial fulfillment for CSE 713 - ADVANCED SYNTACTIC PATTERN RECOGNITION under MSc. in CSE Program, BRAC University.  

In this tutorial, you'll find an overview of filtering, faceting, and clustering a dataset using OpenRefine. I've also tried to discuss the clustering algorithms used by OpenRefine.  

There are mainly two clustering methodologies of clustering a dataset:  

1. Key Collision.  
2. Nearest Neighbor.  

Under the Key Collision method, there are 6 keying functions to do clustering. These are:  
1. Fingerprint.  
2. Ngram-Fingerprint.  
3. Metaphone3.  
4. Cologne-Phonetic.  
5. Daitch-Mokotoff.  
6. Beider-Morse.  

And under Nearest Neighbor, there are 2 clustering functions:  
1. Levenshtein.  
2. PPM  

I've discussed each of these algorithms in a brief. If you have any questions regarding these, leave a comment here.
